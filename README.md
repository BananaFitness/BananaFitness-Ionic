# Covalent Fitness

> Social platform for fitness enthuiasts and their friends all in a mobile iOS and Android app. Built with Ionic, Node.js, Express, Sequelize, and PostgreSQL.

  Allows the user to share workouts and follow the plans of others. A great way to have a collection of all your friends'
  fitness plans.

  Current implementations of collaborative fitness do not make it easy for users to create workout templates
  that are easily usable/sharable with their friends. Current implementations do not allow users to access every detail
  of other users workouts, which would helpful for those trying to achieve certain fitness goals.
  
  Bananafit provides a medium for collabortive sharing of fitness plans.
